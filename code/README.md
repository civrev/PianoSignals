Summary of each file

- GetTwoFactors.m: Generates factors of 2 (2^1-2^9)
- filterDemo.m: An advanced demonstration of how each key goes from real world signal through the algorithm to the detected signal. Examples of what to run are commented in the bottom of the file
- fullDemo.m: The final product, runs through all the signals for each key of desired piano
- keyFilter.m: Using my algorithm based off the Pythagorean scale for the musical notes, detect the base frequency of a piano key from it's real world signal
- keyPlotting.m: This is what plots the keys against the A440 standard, and makes it look nice
- pianoArawSignal.mat: The real world signal I collected by playing this piano in front of a microphone - Digital Piano
- pianoBrawSignal.mat: The real world signal I collected by playing this piano in front of a microphone - Grand Piano
- pianoCrawSignal.mat: The real world signal I collected by playing this piano in front of a microphone - Upright Piano
- processKeys.m: Associating the signals with the note that they represent
- realKeyFreqs.mat: The frequencies of the A440 standard, what it should map to
